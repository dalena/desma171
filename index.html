                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            Compressed Cinema is a studio that explores time-based media as new forms that synthesize
                            histories of creative coding, gaming, cinema, avant-garde film, and experimental video. In
                            this class we will watch, read, create, and discuss. We will screen cinematic works from the
                            last century and discuss them as a group. We will study and discuss a collection of texts.
                            After completing a series of short projects, each participant will create a work
                            self-defined as Compressed Cinema. This work will be screened at the end of the quarter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through the last half of the 20th Century, cinema moved from single-screen presentations to
                            multiple screen installations through a shift in architecture and technologies that moved
                            from film to video to digital media. Compressed cinema is a return to the apparatus of the
                            theater. It is also a post-analog approach to time-based images where animation, video,
                            code, and photography are integrated, rather than separated media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For everyone in the class, there are four primary assignments. There are three projects,
                            followed by the majority of the quarter producing a larger, self-defined work. The final
                            class session will be a screening of the work followed by a discussion. Our class screening
                            and review will be followed by a public presentation of the work.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>You must attend each class, participate in discussions, and complete all assignments. Grading
                            is based on the initial exercises, the final project, and active participation during class
                            meetings. Punctuality, focus, articulation of concepts, and contribution to class
                            discussions are all part of class participation. The numeric breakdown for all assignments
                            follow:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>5% — Participation</li>
                            <li>5% — Cinema Image</li>
                            <li>20% — Scanner Cinema</li>
                            <li>20% — Rotoshop</li>
                            <li>50% — Final project</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Late assignments may be accepted, but points will be deducted from the score.</p>

                        <p>More than two unexcused absences will lower your final grade by one unit (i.e. an A will
                            become
                            an B). With each additional unexcused absence, the grade will drop an additional unit.</p>

                        <p>Class starts at 2pm. If you are over 10 minutes late, you will receive a tardy. Three tardies
                            are equivalent to one absence.</p>

                        <p>If there is an emergency and you will be late or absent from the class, please email me.</p>

                        <p>If you feel frustrated or you come across other problems, please communicate with me directly
                            and quickly.</p>
                        <h3>Commitment to Equity & Diversity</h3>
                        <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge
                            psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so
                            we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. A
                            collaborative effort between the students and the teacher is needed for creating a
                            supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively
                            and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with
                            the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as an
                            opportunity for everyone to grow and learn from one another. All class members are
                            encouraged to discuss such instances with me so they can be addressed with greater care in
                            the future.</p>
                        <h3>Students with Different Needs</h3>
                        <p>Students with a disability or health-related issue who need a class accommodation should make
                            an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible. It is University policy that students
                            with documented disabilities receive reasonable accommodations through access to classroom
                            information. If you have a physical, psychological/psychiatric or medical condition, or a
                            learning disability that will make it difficult for you to carry out the work outlined in
                            the syllabus, or that will require additional time for taking exams and completing
                            assignments, please notify me and visit the UCLA Center for Accessible Education in the
                            first two weeks of the quarter so that we may make appropriate arrangements. All information
                            and documentation is confidential.</p>

                    <h3>Cinema Image — Due October 1 🧠</h3>

                    <p>Create a looping, time-based visual experience under one minute long that is created entirely
                        from a
                        single image. Produce the video at 1920 × 1080 pixels and export in MP4 format. Use any software
                        you
                        choose or write your own code to transform the single, static image into a series of video
                        frames.
                        Upload your video to the class server before 2pm on October 1st. Name the file "P1_YourName.mp4"
                    </p>



                    <h3>Scanner Cinema — Due October 15 📽</h3>


                    <p>The Scanner Cinema project builds on ideas explored in Cinema Image. A single image (or set of
                        images) will provide the frames for your video. Use as many images at any size you need to get
                        the
                        frames required to realize your idea. As discussed in class, these images are a map of the
                        video’s
                        structure in time.</p>


                    <p>There are three primary ways to approach the sources images you create: drawing/painting (Lye,
                        Brakhage), geometry (Sharits,Vasulka), and material collage (Brakhage). I’m open to discussing
                        other
                        ideas.</p>


                    <p>For Scanner Cinema, the process of creating the frames from the image(s) will be automated with
                        code. This project combines creating the source images and making modifications to a provided
                        code
                        template. The code changes can be minimal, or they can be more involved depending on your ideas
                        and
                        your interests.</p>


                    <p>The final video must be 1920 × 1080 pixels and in MP4 format. Name the file "P2_YourName.mp4"</p>


                    <i>Part 1 — Due October 3</i>
                    <p>Develop a plan for your video that can be clearly communicated to others. Prepare a set of
                        diagrams,
                        drawings, and/or text. We’ll discuss your plan in class.</p>


                    <i>Part 2 — Due October 8</i>
                    <p>Create a few tests for your video idea. Through this step, you’ll figure out your video grid in
                        relationship to your selected scanner resolution. This is straightforward, but it can be tricky
                        at
                        first. Your video grid, as shown in class, will determine how many large images you’ll need to
                        create and scan to produce the desired number of frames. For example, if you scan and crop to
                        7,680
                        × 6,480 pixels, you can get 24 frames at 1920 × 1080 pixels (1920 × 4 = 7680 and 1080 × 6 =
                        6480.)
                        You’ll also need to figure out the frames per second (fps) for the video to know how many frames
                        you’ll need. Will the fps be 12, 24, 30, 60, or something else? For example, 240 frames at 12
                        fps is
                        20 seconds of video. Try a range of different frames per second to see what works well for your
                        idea. Technical Note: If your scans are larger in size than Processing can load into memory, you
                        can
                        increase the memory available for Processing in the Preferences (Increase maximum available
                        memory
                        to: []), but you may also need to cut your image image into smaller pieces than can be loaded.
                    </p>


                    <i>Part 3 — Due October 10</i>

                    <p>Create a first draft of your video from what you learned from Part 2. This should be near the
                        final
                        form for the video, but somewhere between 20% and 50% of the duration. You’ll have five days
                        from
                        Thursday to Tuesday to refine and complete the video from Part 3 to 4..</p>


                    <i>Part 4 — Due October 15</i>
                        <p>Upload your final video to the class server before 2pm on October 15th.</p>



                        <h3>Rotoshop — Due October 29 🎨</h3>
                        <p>Working in small teams of two to four, you will draw frames and write custom code to create a
                            short
                            animation. The Rotoshop project will be created through rotoscoping, an early animation
                            technique
                            where artists trace sequences of photographic images. This technique was essential to
                            cinematic
                            works such as:</p>

                            <li>Gulliver’s Travels (1939)</li>

                        <p>In collaboration, each team will develop an idea for their animation that will include
                            creating a
                            custom drawing tool to render the animation. Go back and forth between coding and drawing
                            and
                            drawing and coding to develop the software and the rendering style in tandem.</p>


                        <p>This is a short, two-week project with many elements that include writing custom code,
                            drawing
                            frames, and coordinating with others. You may shoot your own video to rotoscope or you may
                            modify/transform existing “footage.” Keep the scope simple and spend time on the details of
                            the
                            craft. Your animation can be as short as ten seconds at 12fps to encourage quality over
                            quantity.
                            Audio is optional.</p>


                        <p>Processing will be the default software environment for creating your custom software drawing
                            tools,
                            but if another platform is better for your project, let’s discuss it. It’s important that
                            each
                            project idea includes some custom software development. We’ll review the basics of working
                            with
                            Processing in class on Thursday, 17 October.</p>


                        <i>Part 1 — Due October 22
                    </i>
                    <p>Create a series of strategic, short rotoscoping tests for your animation idea and complete the
                        video
                        frames you will rotoscope. We’ll review the tests 1:1 in class.</p>


                    <i>Part 2 — Due October 24</i>
                    <p>Continue to create short tests. From these explorations, determine the final software features
                        and
                        rendering technique. We’ll review these new tests 1:1 in class.</p>


                    <i>Part 3 — Due October 29</i>
                    <p>Upload your final video to the class server before 2pm on October 29th.</p>



                    <h3>CMPRSSD Cinema — Due December 5 🦠</h3>


                    <p>As a final project, create a work of “compressed cinema,” as you define it. This work will be
                        screened during the last class session and will be discussed. We will have a public screening at
                        6pm
                        on December 10th. The work can be of any duration, but we can only screen each work for a
                        maximum of
                        five minutes during the final screenings. You may work individually or in small groups. You are
                        encouraged to utilize code to create/manipulate video and/or the final project might be
                        cinematic,
                        nonlinear software. Your work for the final screening can be video or live software, either
                        autonomous or performed. The only restriction is that your work must be one image channel and up
                        to
                        two audio channels.</p>


                    <p>The final project is broken down into three parts, each with separate evaluations:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>20% — Part 1, Idea development and communication</li>
                        <li>30% — Part 2, Process media and creating tests</li>
                        <li>50% — Part 3, Final work as screened on 5 and 10 December</li>
                    </ul>


                    <i>Part 1 — Due November 5</i>
                    <p>Prepare three different ideas for the final project and create a presentation to clearly present
                        these ideas to the class. We’ll discuss the ideas and share our thoughts as a full group. This
                        is an
                        important presentation and we have high expectations for it. Have your media on the class server
                        or
                        online for quick transitions from one person to the next.</p>


                    <i>Part 2A — Due November 12</i>
                    <p>Complete a first series of experiments to work your way toward making decisions about what to
                        create. We’ll review this work in small groups.</p>


                    <i>Part 2B — Due November 19</i>

                    <p>Complete a second, refined set of tests to further explore your final project idea. Final
                        production
                        should begin after this review. We’ll review this work in small groups.</p>


                    <i>Part 2C — Due November 26</i>
                    <p>Test screening. Present your final project in a rough state. We’ll review this work in small
                        groups.</p>


                    <i>Part 3A — Due December 5</i>
                    <p>Final in-class screening; we’ll watch and discuss all final projects. Test your work on the
                        classroom hardware during the week before the final review to make sure your work appears and
                        sounds
                        as you want it to.</p>


                    <i>Part 3B — Due December 10</i>
                    <p>Public screening in the EDA. The EDA is open that day for testing from noon – 1pm and 5 – 6pm.
                        Test,
                        test, and test your work again to make sure everything is working well with the EDA setup. The
                        final
                        files for the project are due on the class server</p>
